Socket revision
- Python socket.setsockopt(socket.SOL_SOCKET, socket.SO_REUSEADDR, 1) to
  conveniently debug.
- Client socket send and read, if other client close, the connection reset will occur.
- socket.socket(socket.AF_INET, socket.SOCK_STREAM)
- blocking and non-blocking socket. non-blocking use select or poll or epoll or kqueue.
- Server 3 ways to handle client socket:
  - one thread per socket, if blocking socket and client side socket died. it will
  cost long time to cycle the resource.
  - fork new process per socket
  - restructure non-blocking sockets and use select.
- Fundamental truth of sockets:
  messages musth either be fixed length or delimited or indicate how long or
  end by shutting down connection.
